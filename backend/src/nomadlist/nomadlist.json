Lived in a bunch of cities around the US. CDMX is my favorite. That being said, it's still Latin America. Take precautions. I grew up in the NYC area around the gangs and stuff of the 90s and 00s. Here are a few tips to strongly consider\n\n1) Live in Polanco, no farther north than Juarez, no father south than Escandon (unless you're going to Coyocan), no farther east than Roma or Doctores. All assuming you want to be near some action. Don't listen to these wannabe \"woke\" people. These areas the cops tend to be around and about. As well as other tourist and likes of. \n\n2) Uber everywhere thats too far to walk. Definitely at night. From Escandon to Roma is about 40 pesos (2 USD). While, the metro is much cheaper, there's a reason they have a female only car. Also you have to really know here you're going\n\n3) The people here are awesome. Made some solid friends.

Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore. \n\nFood in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.\n\n My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.\n\nI will return to Bengaluru in the future.","slug":"bengaluru-india","short_slug":"bengaluru","long_slug":"bengaluru-india","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":54,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/bengaluru-india-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u73ed\u52a0\u7f57\u5c14","name":"Bengaluru","country_chinese":"\u5370\u5ea6","air_quality_now":68,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"12.9715987","longitude":"77.5945627","country":"India","country_code":"IN","country_slug":"india","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":18,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.017142857142858,"humidity":"92","rank":16,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"24","temperatureF":"75.694","temperatureC_feels_like":24,"temperatureF_feels_like":75,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":994,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":468,"cost_for_local_in_usd":247,"cost_for_family_in_usd":863.6921389376892,"overall_score":4.195079236550449,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":4.548684210526316,"leisure_quality":"2","safety_level":4.2},{"region":"Europe","population":"1280508","descriptionFromReview":"My husband and I spent about 6 weeks testing Prague in Nov-Dec 2018 as we were considering it as a semi-permanent base of operations for the next year or two.

Accommodation in ultra luxurious condos is reasonable, foot massage whilst tapping out emails (\u00a37 per hour) makes working from here a no brainer. Agree living in the Greenbelt area is a no brainer. Vegetarian choices can be limited in some places but excellent (and so cheap!) Delivery services are available, including diet chef stuff which is unaffordable anywhere else.  The streets feel safe inside Makati and the areas around greenbelt and I have never felt uneasy in good areas, which is not the same as London where you are constantly feeling at risk. Bureaucracy is tough in Manila though. Just chill, queue, take your laptop to keep you busy, and remember to be unstintingly polite - locals do not deal well with confrontation and you do well to empathise with them rather than get off by being \"right\" .

At the same time, I think the city gets monotonous fast compared to other places where I lived in a similar size. Estonian people don't appear to be very active. It's understandable because most of them are hard-working and outside of the tech-scene lots of people and students work two jobs.\nIt is not so international, and flight connections are not so many.

There is no mingling between locals and foreigners at all, because the city is divided by the river. All the locals live on the left side and all the foreigners on the right side. A few foreign guys date Vietnamese girls, that's it. That means you are living in a bubble with other foreigners which has nothing to do with living in Asia.

It is a genuine melting pot with a huge range of nationalities and cultures living together (the US has a large number of nationalities but there seems to be hard segregations between them geographically, economically, culturally - so they don't mix). The downside is definitely the cost - If you want to live in London you might want to consider getting a London job - so that your income will match the expenses - there's loads of demand for developers (along with most other job types).  I also want to address the strange stereotype perpetuated by Americans that the food is bad - which is laughable having toured North America extensively and found the food to be dire. London has more Michelin star restaurants than nearly anywhere. The food markets are amazing as are the cafes, restaurants and pubs.

Locals and tourists!\n\nI've worked at Garage Society Coworking Space. Pretty nice place.\n\nI don't understand the cons of slow internet. I've bought an LTE 4G Sim card for 10 USD with 10 GB. There's also free and mostly fast wifi at almost every cafe, restaurant, bar and hotel. \n\nAnd about cost of lining: I've met some locals. First local was a single mom with 3 kids living 10 minutes away from pub street by tuk tuk. She is spending only 100 USD for 1 room studio apartment including water and power and 50 USD for food for her and the kids (I've been at her home). Second local was another girl who earned 120 USD per month by working at a hotel.

It was also extremely cheap compared to any US city and I could afford to eat out every meal and go to the fancier restaurants on my US salary. The beauty of the buildings in the center and quick access to nature was my favorite part as well as the beer and drinking culture which is kind of built into the czech blood. There are a lot of traditional czech pubs but also some very interesting hip things that you would see in Berlin or Brooklyn, I was impressed for the size of the city how many quality offerings they had. \n\nAs for cons.. there were a bunch too! Language is hard to learn and Czech people can be hard to warm up to you. Everyone was nice and could speak english but when going out in groups it often switches to Czech. I didnt mind this obviously because I am a visitor in their country but it was hard and felt isolating. The city is small and I felt like I saw almost everything in the 6 months. You can tour the main parts in one day but there are a lot of hidden gems and festivities that happen throughout the seasons to keep it interesting. \n\nI would recommend visiting and living like a local here for a couple of months.

The city very clean with a stunning mix of modern and historic architecture, and arguably has Europe's best public transit in terms of signage, availability, cleanliness and general efficiency. Meanwhile, New York is almost universally filthy and has embarrassingly decrepit public transit everywhere and drab brown brick buildings anywhere outside the hip parts of Manhattan\/Brooklyn.

The level of destitution that one can witness in NYC simply doesn't exist in London (or the rest of western Europe).\n\nPeople are a bit nicer in London. It's easier to make friends in NYC and its nightlife is the world's best, but close friendships can be elusive in both cities due to their sheer size and the fact that most people who have lived there for any significant period of time are already saturated with social contacts. For what it's worth, I will admit that Manhattanites and Brooklynites tend to be far better looking than their central London counterparts, and I prefer the additional sunshine in NYC year-round despite the more extreme temperatures.

No good food. Air quality is very low, returning from any other place I could literally smell the air. And winters (Nov - Mar) are grey and boring, snow is melting and freezing again, everything around is filthy, very depressing, that's why so many Russians who work remotely leave the country and spend winter somewhere in Southern Asia.

Lots of travelers here are smoking weed, it seems to be pretty legal here. internet speeds are good (probably 15 up and down on average but I stayed in one place that was hitting 30) but power cuts are frequent in the summer (monsoon) months. Many hotels, guest houses, airbnbs are fitted with an inverter to combat this (which basically means one or two sockets and lights in the place will still work during a power cut, so make sure your place has an inverter and your modem is plugged into one of the working sockets. No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must!

It has an amazing energy, and it's one of my favorite places ever to buy art (you can buy amazing paintings in the street for a great price!). It's also super interesting to learn about the culture and the history. My main tip is make sure you invest in a good tour guide (especially if not local - the foreigners feel more comfortable to talk about the local reality).\n\nHaving said that, it's a terrible place to work from if you need internet (like most people, right!?). Regardless where you are staying (hotels or \"casa de familia\", which is kind of an airbnb w\/ a family, a great option to live the local culture), you need to buy a \"pre-paid\" internet card and find places where the internet connection actually works. It's usually better in hotels, but if you are in a different place, you will need to find a park or another public space with a strong reception. I was working on a project while there, and thankfully most of what I did was offline. Every time I needed to send an update of my project, I had to walk to a nearby park with my computer to get an \"ok\" reception (depending on the time of the day; in the evening, you see a lot of people in the park with their phones - forget about using the internet!)\n\nFood is also a problem. Most of restaurants that look nice have a terrible food, and googling for options while you are walking around is impossible (internet is hard to connect, remember?). Do your homework beforehand, and always have a good map pinpointing restaurants and places to visit.\n\nStill worth visiting. The history there is unique - I agree there are better cities in Latin America, but none is that singular.  Also, the locals will try to get your money - but this is also the case in many other places in the world (and Havana is not worse than Bangkok, I promise!) You don't need to stay long, just a few days (3-4) is more than enough. Also, don't bother visiting the all inclusive resorts in the country - go somewhere else in the Caribbean (the views will as amazing as in Cuba + the food and drinks will be better)","slug":"havana-cuba","short_slug":"havana","long_slug":"havana-cuba","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":132,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/havana-cuba-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u54c8\u74e6\u90a3","name":"Havana","country_chinese":"\u53e4\u5df4","air_quality_now":21,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"23.159167","longitude":"-82.271056","country":"Cuba","country_code":"CU","country_slug":"cuba","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":4,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"82","rank":112,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"27","temperatureF":"80.878","temperatureC_feels_like":31,"temperatureF_feels_like":88,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1580,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1073,"cost_for_local_in_usd":627,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2192.8037287850857,"overall_score":3.687165129014421,"cost_score":4.908571428571428,"internet_score":0.8973684210526316,"leisure_quality":5,"safety_level":4},{"region":"Europe","population":"1236047","descriptionFromReview":"Sofia is one of the most amazing cities ever, it has old buildings because of the low economic status of the country, but the main cause is from the low number of tourists visiting this lovely country.

For those that want a quieter lifestyle with superb weather year round and a US friendly time zone, this place is hard to beat for the price. One of the largest middle classes in Latin America allows it to have a very high quality of life. Some of the biggest pros are, low crime (lowest I've experienced in Latin America and safer than my hometown in the US), cleanest city in Latin America that I have ever been to, incredibly well preserved colonial downtown yet the city as a whole feels first world and modern, more than enough coworking spaces, wine country just a half hour away with some high quality CHEAP wine, outdoor activities galore with the Sierra Gorda near by, and Mexico City is a short 2.5 hour drive for weekend getaways when you're missing the chaos of a large city. Some cons are that unless you live in the central area of town a car would likely be needed (Ubers are very cheap though), night life is lacking, and this particular region of Mexico is known for having very unremarkable food. The locals are very warm and inviting. I've met quite a lot of expats but few digital nomads, most friends made have been locals. The airport is newly remodeled and has daily direct flights to multiple US cities, and very cheap flights to beach destinations including Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Merida, Huatulco, and Ixtapa.

The place has potential, but is not quite there yet. Pollution can be pretty bad. Otherwise it's very pretty and the people are helpful. You can find workable Internet, but not everywhere. Try Nyarutarama, which has a lot of embassies. Not extremely cheap, but affordable. Definitely take a trip to Lake Kivu and Volcanoes National Park in the North. Food isn't that great. The most common and cheapest way of getting around is by mototaxi, but beware, they can be very careless - we had an accident on day 1 that required medical attention. You need to haggle with taxi drivers, otherwise they'll rip you off. Car rentals could be cheaper for what you get. Malaria is not that much of an issue in the capital. Otherwise, Kigali is very safe for an African capital, you are mostly free to walk around at night. Very hilly, so be prepared for that. Hospital care was OK, although lacking - needed to go to a different hospital for an X-Ray machine that worked, but the doctors were very professional and care was cheap ($10 for an X-Ray at King Faizal hospital, rebandaging and wound cleaning between $8 to $12 each time).\n\nAll in all, I'm happy we went and will probably be back at some point - lots of growth potential.","slug":"kigali-rwanda","short_slug":"kigali","long_slug":"kigali-rwanda","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":32,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/kigali-rwanda-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u57fa\u52a0\u5229","name":"Kigali","country_chinese":"\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe","air_quality_now":71,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"-1.943889","longitude":"30.059444","country":"Rwanda","country_code":"RW","country_slug":"rwanda","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":2,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":3.9485714285714284,"humidity":"84","rank":154,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"25","temperatureF":"77.006","temperatureC_feels_like":25,"temperatureF_feels_like":77,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1443,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1029,"cost_for_local_in_usd":733,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2566.6875,"overall_score":3.6102909438795443,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":0.5210526315789474,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.5},{"region":"Europe","population":"128624","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"rijeka-croatia","short_slug":"rijeka","long_slug":"rijeka-croatia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":32,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/rijeka-croatia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u91cc\u8036\u5361","name":"Rijeka","country_chinese":"\u514b\u7f57\u5730\u4e9a","air_quality_now":6,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"45.3270631","longitude":"14.442176","country":"Croatia","country_code":"HR","country_slug":"croatia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":14,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"83","rank":155,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"14","temperatureF":"57.52","temperatureC_feels_like":13,"temperatureF_feels_like":55,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1443,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":864,"cost_for_local_in_usd":410,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1436.0506693236055,"overall_score":3.6094368134875685,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":3.6480263157894735,"leisure_quality":2,"safety_level":3.7375},{"region":"Africa","population":"16060303","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"lagos-nigeria","short_slug":"lagos","long_slug":"lagos-nigeria","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":14,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/lagos-nigeria-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u62c9\u5404\u65af","name":"Lagos","country_chinese":"\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a","air_quality_now":73,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"6.5243793","longitude":"3.3792057","country":"Nigeria","country_code":"NG","country_slug":"nigeria","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":6,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":3.902857142857143,"humidity":"78","rank":156,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"87.17","temperatureC_feels_like":40,"temperatureF_feels_like":104,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1549,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1155,"cost_for_local_in_usd":525,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1837.3078186596583,"overall_score":3.6058046296795245,"cost_score":4.944,"internet_score":1.4736842105263157,"leisure_quality":3,"safety_level":2.5},{"region":"North America","population":"264488","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"fort-wayne-in-united-states","short_slug":"fort-wayne","long_slug":"fort-wayne-in-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/fort-wayne-in-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u97e6\u6069\u5821","name":"Fort Wayne","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":20,"air_quality":null,"latitude":41.08,"longitude":-85.1386,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"IN","state_chinese":null,"state":"IN","internet_speed":37,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"76","rank":157,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"1","temperatureF":"34.306","temperatureC_feels_like":1,"temperatureF_feels_like":34,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2446,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1664,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1165,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4077.6100000000006,"overall_score":3.6054129883348325,"cost_score":3.918857142857143,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.84197254964005},{"region":"Latin America","population":"1619146","descriptionFromReview":"Carolina is not safe anymore.

Germany, and therefore also Cologne, has most likely the best emergency system in the world (ambulance must arrive within max. 12 minutes - independent of traffic) and no one will ask \"who pays\" when you have a serious illness\/accident. Doctors have a high education as well (you have to be part of the top 5% of high school to enter a medical study).\n\nCold in winter: Well, it is not a tropical country. However, snow is rarely.

city. It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish.

The locals (besides pushy tuktuk drivers) are very friendly though often times their English is too limited to understand you but they still pretend they understand just to be \"helpful\". It's also a great place for learning to surf (I made some real improvement with my skills). \nThe nomad cost is not accurate here. Expect similar or slighter lower cost than Chiang Mai, unless you're eating veggie rice and curry every day. \nIn summary it can be good for living and working if you spend the time to find a place with good wifi or get your own boardband.

I've been there twice a year since 2017. Despite Montegonians warning me about how dangerous it is, using common sense, respecting the locals and their culture, and not being an asshat, unsurprisingly, goes a long way. I'm not big on tourist traps, but stopping by Devon House is a must. If it isn't for the history of its buildings or the beautiful gardens, stop and get an amazing curry goat patty or amazing ice cream. Accommodation costs vary greatly and I've stayed at both the C$80\/night Spanish Dream to $300\/night at Spanish Court. Longer term stays would benefit greatly from having a local Kingstonian's assistance. Transportation costs also vary based on the honesty of your taxi driver. Locals are generally friendly and I was lucky to have experienced the nightlife from the club scene to outdoor reggae parties, and local dancehall parties. I've never felt unsafe but I was also always with locals who knew their way around the city. Food is amazing and pricing varies greatly as well. The culture is not LGBT friendly and the internet infrastructure is spotty even in the better areas. I often found myself without solid access and simply used it as an excuse to enjoy myself versus working. Definitely a city worth visiting either way.

The locals are super friendly and it's super safe.\nThere is a party and live music every night for those that feel like socialising(with the exception of Thursday nights). There's a well equipped gym, Salsa dancing Night every Monday at the schick-kitsch mexican restaurant, stand up paddle, lots of wonderful yoga shalas, kite surfing, snorkelling, diving and lots of food options. It's actually becoming a vegetarian and vegan paradise lately. There's also a co-working space as part of a Yoga Center. Several music and traditional festivals are held every year and it's wonderful to watch local weddings. Land prices are also still reasonable given that the island will be developing at a faster pace now. The quality of people that seem to crowd Gili Air are very different to those that go to Gili Trawangan. Gili Air attracts a 30+ couples, families and friends groups who don't mind splashing out on nice accommodation, spa treatments and great culinary experiences.\nAll in all, my favorite place so far with an average of 322 days of sunshine! The climate doesn't get any better than this anywhere in the world(and given most other exotic islands are prone to hurricanes... there's never been a hurricane or tornado in the Gilis).

favorable on Antalya, but not perfect. The weather was excellent (~26 C almost every day) and the nature of the city is absolutely stunning. The mountains on the west side of the city seem to just explode out of the ocean and it's special to see. That said, the built environment is pretty uninspiring. The center of the city is full of interesting restaurants and shops, but outside of the old town it's not very exciting to look at. My primary complaint, however, is on public transit. It's easy to use the tram to get to\/from the airport and bus station, but outside of those destinations you better be ready to walk (or use a cab, which I try to never do). Wifi was solid but I did have some drops here and there, my apartment was decent, and the city felt pretty safe. It's also incredibly cheap. I tend to be very frugal, so take this with a grain of salt, but you can easily get a quality meal for about $4 US and would have no problem getting an awesome meal for $8 US. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have wanted to stay much longer than the two weeks I was there.","slug":"antalya-turkey","short_slug":"antalya","long_slug":"antalya-turkey","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":6,"users_been_count":55,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/antalya-turkey-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5b89\u5854\u5229\u4e9a","name":"Antalya","country_chinese":"\u571f\u8033\u5176","air_quality_now":88,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"36.88414","longitude":"30.70563","country":"Turkey","country_code":"TR","country_slug":"turkey","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":11,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":3.06,"humidity":"62","rank":221,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"18","temperatureF":"64.648","temperatureC_feels_like":19,"temperatureF_feels_like":66,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":907,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":483,"cost_for_local_in_usd":205,"cost_for_family_in_usd":716.6207294404205,"overall_score":3.524494773912192,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":2.7763157894736845,"leisure_quality":5,"safety_level":4},{"region":"North America","population":93712.5,"descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"yuma-az-united-states","short_slug":"yuma","long_slug":"yuma-az-united-states","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":14,"users_been_count":3,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/yuma-az-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5c24\u9a6c","name":"Yuma","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":30,"air_quality":null,"latitude":32.7253,"longitude":-114.6244,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"AZ","state_chinese":null,"state":"AZ","internet_speed":41,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.885714285714286,"humidity":"11","rank":222,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"21","temperatureF":"69.776","temperatureC_feels_like":21,"temperatureF_feels_like":70,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2896,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1830,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1224,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4284.749999999999,"overall_score":3.523901429273233,"cost_score":3.4045714285714284,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.5940194604857},{"region":"Europe","population":"289128","descriptionFromReview":"Amazing city!

Always do a checkup of a realtor you are contacting. And the statement below that georgian people like to be 'dramatic'. Never experienced so much drama in my life, as from georgian landlords during 6 months of staying in Tbilisi ;)\n\nI disagree with one of the reviews that Tbilisi has no parks. Actually it's super ridiculous thing to say about Tbilisi! The city has plenty of green spaces (Vera Park, Mtatsminda mountain, Turtle Lisi Lake and magical Mziuri and don't forget to mention Vake, where you can climb up the hill and you feel like you just transported yourself outside of the city in ~5mins ). Actually PARKS are my favourite in Tbilisi - because of them, as well as big sidewalks to walk (unseen in Chiang Mai for sure). Person who wrote about the lack of parks had to live on the wrong side of the river - only go for districst like Vera, Vake, Saburtalo and there the choice of parks is broad. \n\nWhat I didn't like about Tbilisi? I confirm that locals are unfriendly. City is very noisy (drivers are agressive, have no respect to pedestrians and beep a lot). \n\nGeorgian goverment wants foreigners in their country so badly but locals mentality (very post soviet one) is not ready. They only want to get your money and the best would be if you dissapear just afterwards.  \n\nAlso you will have hard time to eat out as vegeterian - vegan. Places fully \"green\" are just a few. In other spots you can eat salads\/chaciapuri which is cheese + carbs (for a vegan stays cucumber tomato salad - i wish you luck getting full with it :D).\n\n","slug":"tbilisi-georgia","short_slug":"tbilisi","long_slug":"tbilisi-georgia","users_now_count":4,"users_now_count_est":55,"users_been_count":221,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/tbilisi-georgia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u7b2c\u6bd4\u5229\u65af","name":"Tbilisi","country_chinese":"\u683c\u9c81\u5409\u4e9a","air_quality_now":86,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"41.716667","longitude":"44.783333","country":"Georgia","country_code":"GE","country_slug":"georgia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":14,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":3.105714285714286,"humidity":"92","rank":226,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"6","temperatureF":"41.922","temperatureC_feels_like":6,"temperatureF_feels_like":43,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1171,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":725,"cost_for_local_in_usd":257,"cost_for_family_in_usd":899.8150375939848,"overall_score":3.518431121181326,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":3.5592105263157894,"leisure_quality":4,"safety_level":3.725},{"region":"North America","population":71722,"descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"canton-oh-united-states","short_slug":"canton","long_slug":"canton-oh-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/canton-oh-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5e7f\u5dde","name":"Canton","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":12,"air_quality":null,"latitude":40.799,"longitude":-81.3784,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"OH","state_chinese":null,"state":"OH","internet_speed":41,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"82","rank":227,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf24","temperatureC":"0","temperatureF":"32.774","temperatureC_feels_like":0,"temperatureF_feels_like":0,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2649,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1814,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1180,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4129.253124999999,"overall_score":3.5173509812870836,"cost_score":3.686857142857143,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.6125},{"region":"North America","population":"190894","descriptionFromReview":"Definitely not a safe city.

Living at the \"Candiland Apartment\" which is reasonably priced 2.5 million - 3.5 million rupiah per month. Great view of the city. It's hot here. Usually like 35+ degrees. The beach is all industrial. Usually a lot of traffic. In the southern part of the city there are some small hills which are cool but to go anywhere with nice air, cool temperatures and big mountains it's at least an hour south. Sometimes the locals will give you a dirty look but if you smile at them they perk right up and smile back usually. There's not too much going on here in my opinion. But there are tons of nice restaurants with good views and the Tinder game here is strong. It has nice malls - I bought a new apple laptop here - quality is fine. Prices are good. If you like vegetables and non-fried food it can be both expensive and hard to find. All in all it's a pretty cool city. I could stay here but I've decided to move to Bandung instead with hopes of more green space, less expensive rent and a cooler climate.","slug":"semarang-indonesia","short_slug":"semarang","long_slug":"semarang-indonesia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/semarang-indonesia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u4e09\u5b9d\u5784","name":"Semarang","country_chinese":"\u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a","air_quality_now":34,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"-7.0247702","longitude":"110.3488077","country":"Indonesia","country_code":"ID","country_slug":"indonesia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":8,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.7942857142857145,"humidity":"91","rank":236,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"27","temperatureF":"80.374","temperatureC_feels_like":32,"temperatureF_feels_like":90,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":927,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":620,"cost_for_local_in_usd":487,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1706.0429233329246,"overall_score":3.5123915204856884,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":2.0157894736842104,"leisure_quality":"2","safety_level":3.775},{"region":"North America","population":"150287","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"clarksville-tn-united-states","short_slug":"clarksville","long_slug":"clarksville-tn-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/clarksville-tn-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u514b\u62c9\u514b\u65af\u7ef4\u5c14","name":"Clarksville","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":21,"air_quality":null,"latitude":36.5286,"longitude":-87.3099,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"TN","state_chinese":null,"state":"TN","internet_speed":40,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"78","rank":237,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"8","temperatureF":"47.212","temperatureC_feels_like":7,"temperatureF_feels_like":45,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2617,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1828,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1174,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4107.360000000001,"overall_score":3.512375585467077,"cost_score":3.7234285714285713,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.5023781741951},{"region":"Middle East","population":"474870","descriptionFromReview":"Beirut is a place where ideas are formed, and where art, culture, cuisine and an ardour for life thrive. Bars, restaurants and clubs come and go more frequently than the snow on the mountain peaks that form a backdrop to the city. But finding the new places - only to later realise they have vanished - is what makes for singular, memorable nights on these warm shores of the Mediterranean. Unlike in many other capitals in the region, there is a liberal attitude towards drinking in Beirut, where you will find a wide selection of cocktails and beers. The new tower blocks built after the civil war ended in 1990 have provided no end of rooftop bars - one of the first and biggest is SKYBAR- but it divides opinions thanks to its strict door policies and high prices. Alternatively try B 018, a nightclub with a retractable roof opening onto the stars, and known for its liberal attitude and dance music.","slug":"beirut-lebanon","short_slug":"beirut","long_slug":"beirut-lebanon","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":25,"users_been_count":55,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/beirut-lebanon-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u8d1d\u9c81\u7279","name":"Beirut","country_chinese":"\u9ece\u5df4\u5ae9","air_quality_now":67,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"33.8886289","longitude":"35.4954794","country":"Lebanon","country_code":"LB","country_slug":"lebanon","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":4,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.04,"humidity":"68","rank":238,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"18","temperatureF":"65.252","temperatureC_feels_like":18,"temperatureF_feels_like":64,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2014,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1275,"cost_for_local_in_usd":948,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3318.9019668087467,"overall_score":3.511115024847813,"cost_score":4.412571428571428,"internet_score":0.7914473684210527,"leisure_quality":"5","safety_level":3.5},{"region":"Asia","population":"634161","descriptionFromReview":"Safe for female solo travelers with affordable accommodations.

Women who are bi or lesbian openly hold hands and show affection; not so for gay or bi men, but no harassment. In fact, in a nearby city, they are about to have a major fet life type of party. As for rentals, we tried to find a decent property there, and many low priced options are available, but most are a hella long walk to get to anything. So, it\u2019s walkable in the sense you can walk to _________, it\u2019s just going to be around 20 to 40 minutes to get there. Rentals: Few decent rentals, none up to European or North American standards. In Guanajuato itself, the super affordable properties you see hawked on YouTube by Vloggers are usually in less desirable areas (hella long walks) and are of poor quality. If you want long term rentals, you will probably be subject to the Aval\/Fiador\/Polizia Juridical scam. Supposedly, this is to protect both landlord and tenant like an insurance policy. In reality, it is a scam against landlords, and tenants alike: the tenant pays for lawyers to write up the rental contract (because no one can figure out how to fill in blanks?) and part of the payment is to \u201csecure\u201d the annual rental amount by a pre-paid legal mechanism to sue the tenant for unpaid rent. Since the number one reason for tenant default is change in circumstances leading to inability to pay, this is a worthless remedy. This scam has existed so long, with realtors being a part of the problem, that most the Mexican people are so used to the scam that they think it is necessary to rent property on an annual, non-AirBnB basis. As a lawyer, I have studied this scam extensively and suggest you avoid the Fiador scam at all costs. Put a pin in the map with Guanajuato in the center and draw a 30 mile radius around it and you will find LOTS of properties for sale or rent. The Fiador scam is responsible for much of this. It is a ridiculous barrier to rental property considering it is a worthless scam in the first place. TIP: if you have a rental dispute, it will cost you less than $200 to file suit in the US, they have twenty (20) days to answer in most jurisdictions, and while they are screaming their heads off at each other about how \u201cthere is no jurisdiction\u201d, your response is \u201ctell it to the judge\u201d: most civil defense lawyers will charge a deposit of around $10,000.00 USD to even fight your case. If they fail to respond, you move for a default judgment and take it across the border. The bank will then take the money out of the defendant\u2019s account and you win big time. Considering that Digital Nomads are often targets for scams, manufactured fees not disclosed up front and gringo pricing ripoffs involving property rentals worldwide, remember this technique. Safety: use normal precautions and don\u2019t walk alone at night in dark alleys or bad neighborhoods like any city.

is my hometown and a city I lived in for around 20 years of my life. If you want a place with a climate much warmer that Moscow and lower prices - look no further. This town would be great for you. In terms of speaking the language - you need to know Russian at certain degree, otherwise it might a bit a hard for you to navigate in the city. \nThe main street of the city is Krasnaya street and you can take a bike and go through the whole street and enjoy the beauty and the peace of the city.\nIn terms of natural beauty, go to parks like Solnechniy ostrov, Dendrarium, Zaton, etc. Most likely you'll enjoy the most in the center of the city. If you need to go shopping look no further and go to \"Gallery Krasnodar\" - a huge shopping mall where you can eat, go to movies (in Russian of course, no subtitles) or shop for groceries.\nUber is widely used there, although it's operating under the brand Yandex.Taxi nowadays, so you might rather use that service in Russia.\nOverall, a good city to live in and not expensive. If you want to eat cheap go to a small family-restaurants.\nAir is quite polluted, unfortunately. Driving also not recommended. Streets are narrow and driving is chaotic.\nIf you want something nearby the sea consider Sochi - it's a bit more expensive, but more developed for foreigners, I think.

There are different places to stay and work in Bocas del Toro, throughout the archipelago that offer different experiences. Some places are more remote with high speed internet service, comfortable settings just a bit far so getting into town and enjoying the nightlife can be more difficult. If you want to stay in town there are some options in Bocas Town with co-working spaces like Selinas Hostel, but keep in mind there is a lively nightlife there, so this is great for meeting people but maybe not the best for a quiet night. Some places out of town are Saigon Bay just a few minutes outside of of the center of town. There you can find some quiet bed and breakfasts offering longer term rental options as well as vacation rentals and Airbnbs. Some nice options over Saigon Bay include: Over Water Rentals, Saigon Bay Bed & Breakfast and Barrbara Bed and Breakfast. Further out towards Bluff Beach there are some super cute options like Somewhere or Nowhere, as well as Nomad Tree Lodge, Hummingbird Bed and Breakfast as well as other super cute Airbnbs, keep in mind the further out you are, the higher the chances of having bad internet connection are. Make sure to ask about their internet provider, there are some really good ones that work even in remote areas of Bocas.\n\nLots of restaurants and cafes offer comfortable places to work as well with great internet and excellent dishes and coffees. Try places such as Cafe del Mar, Super Gourmet, and Buena Vista Restaurante.\n\nNightlife and activities are abundant. You will never be bored in Bocas del Toro. After working, enjoy activities such as surfing, bike riding, explore the beaches and reefs, for paddling, go sailing, etc. You can also learn Spanish, look for Habla Ya Spanish Schools they have some great longer term programs. \n\nBocas del Toro is a great spot for digital nomads, you should definitely check this place out!","slug":"bocas-del-toro-panama","short_slug":"bocas-del-toro","long_slug":"bocas-del-toro-panama","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":57,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/bocas-del-toro-panama-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u535a\u5361\u65af\u5fb7\u5c14\u6258\u7f57","name":"Bocas del Toro","country_chinese":"\u5df4\u62ff\u9a6c","air_quality_now":5,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"9.3406","longitude":"-82.2406","country":"Panama","country_code":"PA","country_slug":"panama","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":10,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"77","rank":308,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"28","temperatureF":"82.378","temperatureC_feels_like":31,"temperatureF_feels_like":88,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1917,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1262,"cost_for_local_in_usd":575,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2011.59375,"overall_score":3.4615801427456816,"cost_score":4.523428571428572,"internet_score":2.4621710526315788,"leisure_quality":"5","safety_level":2.5125},{"region":"North America","population":"403090","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"tulsa-ok-united-states","short_slug":"tulsa","long_slug":"tulsa-ok-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":33,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/tulsa-ok-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5854\u5c14\u8428","name":"Tulsa","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":24,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"36.1519752","longitude":"-96.1581975","country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"OK","state_chinese":"","state":"Oklahoma","internet_speed":37,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"66","rank":309,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"12","temperatureF":"52.868","temperatureC_feels_like":12,"temperatureF_feels_like":54,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2863,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":2285,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1327,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4645.458125,"overall_score":3.460786322925926,"cost_score":3.442285714285714,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":2.971166739182025},{"region":"Europe","population":"631695","descriptionFromReview":"A lot more things to do there on Summer than on Winter, even though the city is beautiful both seasons.

Linnanm\u00e4ki amusement park is also nice if you are traveling with children. On Winter I recommend you leave the city center and go to f.ex. Mustikkamaa or Central Park.

It has everything you need centrally located and the small surrounding suburbs have great school systems. Downtown Des Moines boasts a smorgasbord of delicious bakeries, coffee shops, and non-chain restaurants. They have recently added bike lanes to make it more pedestrian friendly. There are quite a few bars and nightclubs  on Court Ave. to keep you entertained. Some have live entertainment, outside patios, and a cover to get in. \n\nSomething else I love about Des Moines: its many parks and hiking trails! Plenty to do during the summer between that and the many festivals that seem to be going on every other weekend. \n\nDes Moines isn\u2019t bad but it can be very slow so I wouldn\u2019t  recommend it to my thrill seekers: you\u2019ll be bored! However, if you\u2019re a nomad looking for a place to lay low and take things slow for a bit or, you\u2019re a family looking for a better life: Des Moines is for you!

has so much to offer and so much to do. It is easily overwhelming. Whereas I usually take my first week to explore a place Tokyo\u2019s sights just kept on going. I remember ending up in a hidden cocktail bar, a mexican rooftop party with 1 meter margaritas, spending a whole day going only to French places(?), visiting a store that only imported 2nd hand hiphop apparel, and throughout it all the best michelin star ramen. It just seemed endless, completely unrelated and incredibly fun. Six weeks went by in an instant. \n\nMoney wise Tokyo is expensive, especially for Asia and in some areas like housing and mobile and ok but not cheap for (incredible) transport and tickets prices. Superb food and drinks can be had for cheap. The quality and service for most things is top-notch. \n\nBesides some large parks Tokyo is a lot of concrete and I had to look a bit harder to find green than I normally do. Finding a good place to run was also difficult without bumping into people. Though if you look for it there are a lot of serene quiet corners, temples and gardens. Cycling in Tokyo is easy, so consider renting a bike and explore a neighborhood or two.\n\nCommunication was never difficult, though often a bit awkward. In general Japanese will try and leave you alone or be polite and superficial. This all changes completely as soon as you start drinking alcohol or even sober when they find a common interest. I found Japanese in social settings curious and easy to speak with and at times students\/young-japanese would come up to me and talk. Nobody will disturb you when reading a book or doing some work. People are are just incredibly polite. Socially in hang around mostly with expats. Since coworking spaces were expensive I went mostly to meetups to meet people. \n\nFor housing I\u2019d advise to stay outside of the central places and near a subway line. I stayed in Kichijoji, which was 15min from Shibuya and Shinjuku, more affordable and less busy. Most people only spend a few days in this city and handle Japan by planning obsessively. Ask anybody about to go to Japan what their plan is and they\u2019ll start drawing maps and timetables.

It's a lot more expensive now (2020) than posted. 1-bdr in center is $3,500-$4,000 + $200-$300 for parking + $100-$200 for utilities. Almost impossible to find month-to-month rent, so this is for 1-year lease. Coffee for two + a pastry is easily $20. Dinner for two never less than $50, unless it's fast food (+20% tips are expected) and if you want actually something good it's at least $100 for two. Airbnb is $150+ for a room, god know how much for a whole place. We've been living rather frugally, and our total bill a month is $6,000-$8,000 (we almost never go out and have our own car). I would not recommend living here unless your income is AT LEAST $150,000\/year (for basic). We started feel comfortable with our expenses only when our total income hit $300,000. In terms of safety, it's really really bad. We live on a quiet street, but we have cars broken-in right under our window literally every week. I (female) don't go out alone after dark. And that's given that our place is one of the safest (South Beach) and quietest in the central part of the city.

An amazing city with contrasts, modern and  age-old wonders everywhere you look. Stayed near the main medina (pictured above) and that was a good location to see everything.  Internet was good, and my tunnel service functioned fine.  Weather is variable at this time of year... as a Canadian I had breakfast on a rooftop terrace at +1C and thought it was absolutely fine, but it also hit +27C later that day... dress in layers. Walk like you know where you are going and you'll be fine... the place is full of tourists (this was pre-covid). People are trying to make a living and will try to hustle you- don't be intimidated, just keep on moving.  Prices for eating out were reasonable, and I was pretty careful about water consumption.  My traveling companion got one bad meal from a streetside vendor (and a night in the toilet), but it didn't happen to me, so just be aware.  Bank machines from major banks gave good exchange rates, just be aware of your surroundings as you use them.  Got my laundry done for the equivalent of $2USD, which was a good deal (and they literally pressed the socks and underwear, too).  If you know French you have it made here,  some know English, too. See the Yves St. Lauren Museum, just check the times and days before you go. the food is amazing and varies (don't gert stuck eating Tagine every day). Alcohol is strictly controlled- package stores are few and you will need your passport to buy it. I will be back to Marrakesh, for sure... but I was here in December and I hear its REALLY HOT in the summer, so be aware.","slug":"marrakesh-morocco","short_slug":"marrakesh","long_slug":"marrakesh-morocco","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":200,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/marrakesh-morocco-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u9a6c\u62c9\u5580\u4ec0","name":"Marrakesh","country_chinese":"\u6469\u6d1b\u54e5","air_quality_now":48,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"31.6346215","longitude":"-8.0078531","country":"Morocco","country_code":"MA","country_slug":"morocco","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":6,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.474285714285714,"humidity":"68","rank":382,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"14","temperatureF":"57.936","temperatureC_feels_like":14,"temperatureF_feels_like":57,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2108,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1520,"cost_for_local_in_usd":722,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2526.5854845888502,"overall_score":3.4086155226697823,"cost_score":4.305142857142857,"internet_score":1.5,"leisure_quality":5,"safety_level":3.675},{"region":"North America","population":"33835","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"kearney-ne-united-states","short_slug":"kearney","long_slug":"kearney-ne-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/kearney-ne-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":null,"name":"Kearney","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":22,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"40.6995","longitude":"-99.0819","country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"NE","state_chinese":null,"state":"NE","internet_speed":33,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"59","rank":383,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"10","temperatureF":"49.67","temperatureC_feels_like":9,"temperatureF_feels_like":48,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3012,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1858,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1491,"cost_for_family_in_usd":5219.6,"overall_score":3.4081536380471866,"cost_score":3.272,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.6125},{"region":"North America","population":"194920","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"shreveport-la-united-states","short_slug":"shreveport","long_slug":"shreveport-la-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/shreveport-la-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u4ec0\u91cc\u592b\u6ce2\u7279","name":"Shreveport","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":30,"air_quality":null,"latitude":32.5222,"longitude":-93.7652,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"LA","state_chinese":null,"state":"LA","internet_speed":61,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.885714285714286,"humidity":"66","rank":384,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"14","temperatureF":"56.664","temperatureC_feels_like":14,"temperatureF_feels_like":57,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2842,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1737,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1313,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4595.260000000001,"overall_score":3.4079610421202404,"cost_score":3.466285714285714,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.017555968673375},{"region":"Europe","population":"1974819","descriptionFromReview":"Spent a month in Belarus this July - we have some good friends there we work with so it was an excellent time.

Felt kind of like the country is just starting to open up and it will be of more international interest in the upcoming 5 - 10 years.  English is spoken in Minsk but probably less then in ukraine (my only other former soviet point of comparison).  \n\nFor entertainment, there's not much going on during the week but Zbitskaya street friday and saturday has bars overflowing into the streets during the summer time.  It was a bit more expensive then I was expecting but I didn't really try to hustle for the best apartment rates. \n\nThere's a bit of bureaucracy when it comes to renting an apartment, as a foreigner on a visa I had to notify the government of my whereabouts.  I changed apartments and this resulted in me, my friend (who speaks russian) and the new landlord having to spend half a day at a government office updating them.

It is a less interesting place in Mauritius to stay or spend time.  I would recommend either the North or the west coast of the Island. Trou aux Biches or Flic en Flac are two really good options. You will be at most 5 mins walk away from a postal card beach while still having very good working conditions (good wifi). What I love about Mauritius is the variety of things to do, even though it is quite a small Island, you have numerous amazing hikes (I would clearly recommend Le Morne Hike), lots of postal cards beaches, natural parks, all type of sea activities from submarine tube to perfect kiting conditions. Also, one thing I can't really agree is the racial tolerance score that Nomad List gave them because it is quite ironic in a country where 25% of people are Christians, 40% are Hindus and 15% are Muslims that there is no racial tolerance. Mauritius is one of the most peaceful countries I had the chance to visit where the mix of culture is the most unique. You can literally find a Church, a Mosque and a Temple 30 meters away from each other. It is also one of the most politically stable and the 2nd most developed country of Africa so they have that mix of modernity and Island vibes. If you are a digital nomad going to Mauritius, I would clearly recommend you to contact Island trotter (it is a kind of digital nomad consultant based there) and they will organize everything for you so that you get the best experience. Gael and Jean have been very very helpful during my visit there and they made my trip amazing.

a whole month in Fort Kochi area, eventually going to Ernakulam (downtown area). It is unarguably very different than rest of India, much more cleaner and with friendlier people. Beaches aren`t nice for bathing but are a great choice to catch sunsets everyday. Cost of living is dirty cheap and public transport is good. They even have a subway crossing the city with reminds me the BTS in Bangkok. Actually, Kochi to me is like a small and boring version of Bangkok, which is good if you need a cheap place to get the work done while enjoy the sunsets and South Indian

Most of the rest of the city is a filthy and decrepit dump. There are some nice beaches 30+ min away from the city. When using the \"wawa\" bus system, you can flag down and exit a bus anytime, but I definitely recommend renting a car while here because its timetables can't be found on the internet, its stations are not signed, its bus lines are not labeled clearly, it's never on schedule, and it's generally not worth your time.

there for 6 months. Incredibly \"tough\" city. Everything is concrete or dirt. Still has a Soviet vibe in 2020. One main street in the city center is vibrant and modern, but head one metro stop in any direction and its 1982 all over again. Almost no English, even with young people. Russian is preferred language even through there is a very strong anti-Russia\/anti-Putin sentiment in the city, and rightfully so. However, all the street names and landmarks are in Ukrainian, so you need to mix the languages. Zero problem for natives, but can be confusing for foreigners. Sidewalks are destroyed, a pair of shoes would be ruined in a month or two. Housing is old and gloomy. Small apartments, bad utilities. Sometimes I'd go without water in my apartment for days. Winter never ends. Extreme cold and snow. I would take Ubers and lots of the cars were without seatbelts. These are some tough people. Only salvation is that its cheap, but you can find that in hundreds of other cities.

Lovely people and a lot of nature around. The beautiful Colca Canyon is near, where you can also see the Andean Condor or book multiple-day hiking tours. It is close to Puno which you should visit as well and it's easy to go to Cusco from here, to see the famous Macchu Picchu.\n\nFor working it wasn't that great, unfortunately, with slow internet and the available coworking spaces not quite as nice as I had hoped.

August 28-September 2, September 7, September 11 2019.  Got a friend to pick me up at the airport, so I can't evaluate how well UBER works from the airport. Prepaid taxi from the airport is my usual recommendation, and if I was traveling tomorrow that is what I would do. Inside of Mumbai, UBER was my go-to app and worked well.  Autos (aka 'Tuk-tuks' in some places)  get around well and are cheap, some are also on Uber.  Be aware that unless you use a service like UBER, as a foreigner, the price will go up if you do not look and act like a local when you flag down your ride.\n\nFood was varied and can be had in any variety, veg or non=veg, any nationality or region.  Alcohol is available if you seek it out (some places will even deliver it to you with your pizza :).  There are bars and night life in Mumbai that are fun, and feel free to get swept up in festival crowds in the earlier parts of the evening in major metropolitan areas. I never felt unsafe in Mumbai, but do not throw good traveler caution to the wind here.\n\nInternet was spotty at times, but that may have just been my location.  The internet tunnel I  used worked, but YMMV.  JIO was my phone provider of choice, and it seemed to work all across India. The city is historic and modern, slow and fast, very very rich, and desperately poor. Although prices here are higher relative to all other places in India, I will return to Mumbai (Bombay), and you should too... no one person can ever see it all.","slug":"mumbai-india","short_slug":"mumbai","long_slug":"mumbai-india","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":206,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/mumbai-india-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5b5f\u4e70","name":"Mumbai","country_chinese":"\u5370\u5ea6","air_quality_now":165,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"19.0759837","longitude":"72.8776559","country":"India","country_code":"IN","country_slug":"india","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":11,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":0.8,"humidity":"48","rank":480,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"87.514","temperatureC_feels_like":33,"temperatureF_feels_like":91,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1204,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":913,"cost_for_local_in_usd":586,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2049.898304234974,"overall_score":3.341634006495928,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":2.7552631578947366,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.95},{"region":"Latin America","population":"37074","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"port-of-spain-trinidad-and-tobago","short_slug":"port-of-spain","long_slug":"port-of-spain-trinidad-and-tobago","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":7,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/port-of-spain-trinidad-and-tobago-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u6e2f","name":"Port of Spain","country_chinese":"\u7279\u7acb\u5c3c\u8fbe\u548c\u591a\u5df4\u54e5","air_quality_now":25,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"10.651651","longitude":"-61.508807","country":"Trinidad and Tobago","country_code":"TT","country_slug":"trinidad-and-tobago","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":14,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"77","rank":481,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"30","temperatureF":"85.546","temperatureC_feels_like":37,"temperatureF_feels_like":99,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1942,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1421,"cost_for_local_in_usd":661,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2312.107156914833,"overall_score":3.341533997637154,"cost_score":4.494857142857143,"internet_score":3.4282894736842104,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":1.5},{"region":"Europe","population":"592500","descriptionFromReview":"Genoa is a pearl covered in shit","slug":"genoa-italy","short_slug":"genoa","long_slug":"genoa-italy","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":39,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/genoa-italy-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u70ed\u90a3\u4e9a","name":"Genoa","country_chinese":"\u610f\u5927\u5229","air_quality_now":50,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"44.4056499","longitude":"8.946256","country":"Italy","country_code":"IT","country_slug":"italy","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":17,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.428571428571429,"humidity":"80","rank":482,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"10","temperatureF":"49.182","temperatureC_feels_like":10,"temperatureF_feels_like":50,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2743,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1775,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1082,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3787.5162903470223,"overall_score":3.3405717150737573,"cost_score":3.5794285714285716,"internet_score":4.224342105263158,"leisure_quality":4,"safety_level":3.925},{"region":"North America","population":56629.5,"descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"corvallis-or-united-states","short_slug":"corvallis","long_slug":"corvallis-or-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/corvallis-or-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u79d1\u74e6\u5229\u65af","name":"Corvallis","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":19,"air_quality":null,"latitude":44.5646,"longitude":-123.262,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"OR","state_chinese":null,"state":"OR","internet_speed":42,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"91","rank":483,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"11","temperatureF":"50.958","temperatureC_feels_like":11,"temperatureF_feels_like":52,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3401,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":2302,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1267,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4435.075,"overall_score":3.3405314142637232,"cost_score":2.8274285714285714,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":4.1367771537062},{"region":"Africa","population":"1817524","descriptionFromReview":"Who on earth wrote these reviews ?!

Lots of different neighborhoods to appeal to different types of people: some commercial, some hipstery, some historical, some modern.  Food and rent is cheap (and the food is damn good). People are very friendly as compared to other big Asian cities. You can also get easy work as a tutor and make good extra cash. I survived for five months tutoring and doing other English related work for max 12 hrs a week (leaving me lots of time to work on other projects). You could also easily get a full time teaching gig but that defeats the whole nomad idea i guess. My favorite area is Gulou, or the Drum Tower.

September 3 -8, 2019- Yes, I was in Goa during monsoon season... still it was great for me.  Stayed at a lovely little place [Vivenda Dos Palhacos] and the food was fabulous. The internet speed is good enough for research and streaming, and my Tunnel worked at this site.  At this time of the year, the beaches were vacant, but still beautiful. Some restaurants aren't open as much during monsoon season, but visited several that were, and the food was great.  Alcohol is VERY available in Goa (and I got a bottle of Old Monk Rum for 300 INR). Roads are nuts- I would never drive here except during the day on a scooter, and even then you are taking your life in your hands (in the road are buses, pedestrians, animals of all descriptions, cars, scooters, bicycles, farm tractors, donkey carts, motorcycles... and more.... Now imagine it at night, very busy,  with only half the headlights\/tailights working... on a barely 2 lane road).   People are friendly, but English does not seem to be as prevalent as, say, in Mumbai or Bangalore or Kolkata, and there are a whole other mix of languages here.  This is VERY RURAL.  I did not go to the party houses or entertainment districts.   You WILL need Google maps as the roads are not well marked.  JIO phone service is good here. Cash is important here, as with all rural areas of India, but sit-down restaurants took plastic just fine. I never felt unsafe here, but that's just me, YMMV.  I will return to Goa again.","slug":"goa-india","short_slug":"goa","long_slug":"goa-india","users_now_count":2,"users_now_count_est":27,"users_been_count":103,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/goa-india-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u679c\u963f","name":"Goa","country_chinese":"\u5370\u5ea6","air_quality_now":107,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"15.2993265","longitude":"74.123996","country":"India","country_code":"IN","country_slug":"india","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":8,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":2.625714285714286,"humidity":"54","rank":495,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"33","temperatureF":"90.596","temperatureC_feels_like":37,"temperatureF_feels_like":99,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1549,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":688,"cost_for_local_in_usd":213,"cost_for_family_in_usd":745.3054633187238,"overall_score":3.3334807862793796,"cost_score":4.944,"internet_score":1.96578947368421,"leisure_quality":"5","safety_level":3.95},{"region":"North America","population":76705.5,"descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"scranton-pa-united-states","short_slug":"scranton","long_slug":"scranton-pa-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/scranton-pa-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u65af\u514b\u5170\u987f","name":"Scranton","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":9,"air_quality":null,"latitude":41.4087,"longitude":-75.6621,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"PA","state_chinese":null,"state":"PA","internet_speed":89,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"74","rank":496,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf24","temperatureC":"-0","temperatureF":"31.594","temperatureC_feels_like":-3,"temperatureF_feels_like":27,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3255,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1982,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1327,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4643.325000000001,"overall_score":3.333141387671452,"cost_score":2.994285714285714,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.6125},{"region":"Europe","population":"687775","descriptionFromReview":"Very luxurious yet has some parts of the city that are charming and have gothic architecture.

is a bustling city full of surprises if you look. The downside is rent is on the pricey side than say what you would expect to pay in most places in SEA. You can find some low rental places but then you'd be putting yourself in an environment that's not particularly safe. I'd pick a neighbourhood like Kabulonga, Woodlands, Chilenje, Ibex Hill or Makeni. Getting around is easier if you have a car or find a reliable cabby. You can also use the local rideshare app called Ulendo Taxi, it works well and even has female drivers, which I think is great for solo female travellers.\nPublic safety is okay, best not to travel to compounds where safety can be a major issue, especially if you're a muzungu, a local word for 'White person' or someone considered well-off. Expect to be crowded around by street vendors selling everything from phone accessories, clothing, and sometimes local crafts. I wouldn't advise purchasing from these as you'll get ripped off - best go to the weekend markets or the craft village. \nZambia doesn't have a caf\u00e9 or coffee culture per se but you can find some pretty decent coffee shops that have great coffee and free wifi. Zam Bean Coffee, The Corner Caf\u00e9 and 3Tree's are my favs. I'd advise to join the Expat Group's on Facebook for more tips and questions.\n","slug":"lusaka-zambia","short_slug":"lusaka","long_slug":"lusaka-zambia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":4,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/lusaka-zambia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5362\u8428\u5361","name":"Lusaka","country_chinese":"\u8d5e\u6bd4\u4e9a","air_quality_now":17,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"-15.416786","longitude":"28.2036666","country":"Zambia","country_code":"ZM","country_slug":"zambia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":3,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"92","rank":538,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"24","temperatureF":"75.972","temperatureC_feels_like":24,"temperatureF_feels_like":75,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":771,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":495,"cost_for_local_in_usd":367,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1285.2142575375142,"overall_score":3.2992651039058813,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":0.5621710526315788,"leisure_quality":2,"safety_level":3.0125},{"region":"North America","population":"59628","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"casper-wy-united-states","short_slug":"casper","long_slug":"casper-wy-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/casper-wy-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5361\u65af\u5e15","name":"Casper","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":31,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"42.8666","longitude":"-106.3131","country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"WY","state_chinese":null,"state":"WY","internet_speed":36,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.862857142857143,"humidity":"41","rank":539,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"7","temperatureF":"44.282","temperatureC_feels_like":5,"temperatureF_feels_like":41,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3281,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":2128,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1157,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4048.3250000000003,"overall_score":3.298880751298593,"cost_score":2.964571428571429,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.84234336682225},{"region":"Latin America","population":"56899","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"liberia-costa-rica","short_slug":"liberia","long_slug":"liberia-costa-rica","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":21,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/liberia-costa-rica-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5229\u6bd4\u91cc\u4e9a","name":"Liberia","country_chinese":"\u54e5\u65af\u8fbe\u9ece\u52a0","air_quality_now":5,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"10.6331348","longitude":"-85.4440414","country":"Costa Rica","country_code":"CR","country_slug":"costa-rica","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":7,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"82","rank":540,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf24","temperatureC":"29","temperatureF":"83.79","temperatureC_feels_like":35,"temperatureF_feels_like":95,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1257,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":781,"cost_for_local_in_usd":387,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1354.7453058303631,"overall_score":3.298619661761705,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":1.5848684210526311,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":2.2125},{"region":"North America","population":59684,"descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"idaho-falls-id-united-states","short_slug":"idaho-falls","long_slug":"idaho-falls-id-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/idaho-falls-id-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u7231\u8fbe\u8377\u5dde\u7011\u5e03","name":"Idaho Falls","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":17,"air_quality":null,"latitude":43.4931,"longitude":-112.0443,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"ID","state_chinese":null,"state":"ID","internet_speed":43,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"63","rank":541,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"2","temperatureF":"35.402","temperatureC_feels_like":2,"temperatureF_feels_like":36,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3372,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1961,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1074,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3758.2625,"overall_score":3.2981281721443265,"cost_score":2.8605714285714283,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.59117652875565},{"region":"North America","population":"184508","descriptionFromReview":"Worcester is a hidden gem among the bigger cities.

is a dirty, ugly city across the causeway from northern Singapore. It's a very busy crossing both ways. I've been here many times to shop with my wife and MIL but have nothing to recommend. It was at least a cheap place to get glasses. Last time I went the 1MDB project had been launched to great fanfare in Johor. It was supposed to the the project that would unseat Singapore. It turned out to be a big scam and lots of people lost money, especially the Malay taxpayers. \nOther parts of Malaysia are fantastic (Borneo, Penang, KK, KL). Johor is kind of lousy.

Many parts of Dayton-proper are still experiencing severe poverty but a few area are beginning to see gentrification. The area has moved away from the large-scale industry which has all but abandoned the area and now experiences a lot of growth through local entrepreneurs including a rich culture of Craft Beer brewing, tattoo shops, cafes, music, and a variety of other \"fun\" businesses. While Dayton, itself, is growing fast and the housing prices can be extremely cheap, one will find that the surrounding suburbs host a large portion of the local population and are not lacking in entertainment or cultural life. The metroparks are outstanding and bike trails are rapidly tying various areas together. Technology-wise, the area has two universities and a large Air Force base so one would find mostly enterprise-level organizations. There is a lot of potential to grow the local technology scene and Dayton hosts one of the largest HAM Radio festival annually.","slug":"dayton-oh-united-states","short_slug":"dayton","long_slug":"dayton-oh-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":10,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/dayton-oh-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u987f","name":"Dayton","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":53,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"39.7589478","longitude":"-84.1916069","country":"United

Extremely affordable. But so far it definitely doesn't feel like the place to be if what you're looking for is night life, socializing, and entrepreneurial communities. Internet speed is great. Weather is good. Things are quiet.","slug":"malacca-malaysia","short_slug":"malacca","long_slug":"malacca-malaysia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":39,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/malacca-malaysia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u9a6c\u516d\u7532","name":"Malacca","country_chinese":"\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a","air_quality_now":58,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"2.189962","longitude":"102.249837","country":"Malaysia","country_code":"MY","country_slug":"malaysia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":17,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.2457142857142856,"humidity":"75","rank":604,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf24","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"86.958","temperatureC_feels_like":39,"temperatureF_feels_like":102,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1025,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":722,"cost_for_local_in_usd":371,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1298.9599753694583,"overall_score":3.261155523330417,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":4.2437499999999995,"leisure_quality":3,"safety_level":3.1375},{"region":"North America","population":"100515","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"flint-mi-united-states","short_slug":"flint","long_slug":"flint-mi-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/flint-mi-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u71e7\u77f3","name":"Flint","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":13,"air_quality":null,"latitude":43.0172,"longitude":-83.7236,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"MI","state_chinese":null,"state":"MI","internet_speed":46,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"74","rank":605,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"-0","temperatureF":"31.224","temperatureC_feels_like":0,"temperatureF_feels_like":0,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3275,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":2248,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1299,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4545.753124999999,"overall_score":3.2611271539711946,"cost_score":2.9714285714285715,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.017494165809675},{"region":"Africa","population":"1109300","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"onitsha-nigeria","short_slug":"onitsha","long_slug":"onitsha-nigeria","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/onitsha-nigeria-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5965\u5c3c\u67e5","name":"Onitsha","country_chinese":"\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a","air_quality_now":50,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"6.1496822","longitude":"6.7598475","country":"Nigeria","country_code":"NG","country_slug":"nigeria","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":4,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.428571428571429,"humidity":"72","rank":606,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"34","temperatureF":"93.202","temperatureC_feels_like":47,"temperatureF_feels_like":117,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1371,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":787,"cost_for_local_in_usd":323,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1131.3795466491458,"overall_score":3.26044189035622,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":0.9950657894736842,"leisure_quality":"2","safety_level":2.5},{"region":"Middle East","population":"429515","descriptionFromReview":"One of my favourite places to visit.

I was there September 8-14, 2019. A friendly and beautiful city, but it helps to have a guide. I did a hotel stay as the prices were a tiny percentage of the same accomodation in Mumbai.  Internet was good.  Tunnel worked here (but that may just have been my access point). There are internet cafes (Cafe Coffee is one)... but there is also Starbucks.  Prices at restaurants are lower than other spots I visited in India. I did not do the street food here, but thats just me. By nature this is a very vegetarian region of India, so be prepared... however, they sure can cook, so you may not miss it.  I came in by train from Mumbai, but the airport has a fancy new (and empty) terminal. Get around by UBER or Auto (tuk-tuk), but you need cash for the latter.  There was flooding in August, the month before I arrived, but all was well by early September... keep an eye on the monsoon forecast.  The historic sites are stunning, the mosaic tile work, etc at the palaces... and please realize that they were only built around 1900 (yes that palace photo above in Nomadlist is a building built in 1900 by a British architect, not 500 or 1000 years earlier... but it IS gorgeous in person).  I will return to Vadodara again... but I'll give you a tip- pronounce it as Baroda and you will be fine.","slug":"vadodara-india","short_slug":"vadodara","long_slug":"vadodara-india","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/vadodara-india-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5df4\u7f57\u8fbe","name":"Vadodara","country_chinese":"\u5370\u5ea6","air_quality_now":142,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"22.3071588","longitude":"73.1812187","country":"India","country_code":"IN","country_slug":"india","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":7,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":1.8257142857142856,"humidity":"41","rank":622,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"87.068","temperatureC_feels_like":32,"temperatureF_feels_like":90,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":867,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":382,"cost_for_local_in_usd":154,"cost_for_family_in_usd":538.8254918287689,"overall_score":3.2496978975873554,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":1.6578947368421053,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":3.95},{"region":"Europe","population":"195994","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"banja-luka-bosnia","short_slug":"banja-luka","long_slug":"banja-luka-bosnia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":12,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/banja-luka-bosnia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5df4\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5362\u5361","name":"Banja

is a nice place. It's prettiest in the Innere Stadt, like the old city center. So probably stay there. Graz has a very lefty, alternative, hippe vibe to it. You'll see people wear lots of hemp and earth toned clothing and dreadlocks all over the place. Which is kinda fun for a change. The same people you'd see in Ubud or Koh Pha Ngan or Goa, you'll see in Graz. Speaking of the people, they're nice, but they won't smile at you in public mostly. I also wouldn't say it's easy to meet people here, but that's probably Austrian culture. Everyone already got their cliques.\n\nOh one annoying thing, eveeeeeryone smokes here or that's how it feels like. You won't be able to sit anywhere outside without getting smoke in your face.\n\nIn terms of activities, you can do quite a lot of hiking\/walking around Graz in the hills and mountains. It's really beautiful if you just walk half an hour north east which we did.\n\nA nice place to work is Martin Auer, they have a few diff spots around town, really AMAZING coffee and baguette sandwhiches there, you won't believe how good. Also the Kunsthaus Graz has a great cafe with amazing food.\n\nSo TL;DR Graz is a nice little cosy town, fun to stop by for a few days.","slug":"graz-austria","short_slug":"graz","long_slug":"graz-austria","users_now_count":2,"users_now_count_est":18,"users_been_count":86,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/graz-austria-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u683c\u62c9\u8328","name":"Graz","country_chinese":"\u5965\u5730\u5229","air_quality_now":37,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"47.070714","longitude":"15.439504","country":"Austria","country_code":"AT","country_slug":"austria","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":25,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.725714285714286,"humidity":"93","rank":654,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"6","temperatureF":"43.42","temperatureC_feels_like":6,"temperatureF_feels_like":43,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2874,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1537,"cost_for_local_in_usd":933,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3264.4309743900585,"overall_score":3.2338072920851353,"cost_score":3.4297142857142857,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.55},{"region":"Latin America","population":"512880","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"mar-del-plata-argentina","short_slug":"mar-del-plata","long_slug":"mar-del-plata-argentina","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":10,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/mar-del-plata-argentina-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u9a6c\u5fb7\u666e\u62c9\u5854","name":"Mar del Plata","country_chinese":"\u963f\u6839\u5ef7","air_quality_now":21,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"-37.9798584","longitude":"-57.5897942","country":"Argentina","country_code":"AR","country_slug":"argentina","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":12,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"61","rank":655,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"22","temperatureF":"72.35","temperatureC_feels_like":22,"temperatureF_feels_like":72,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1141,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":621,"cost_for_local_in_usd":206,"cost_for_family_in_usd":721.0951143904393,"overall_score":3.233489162391569,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":3.111842105263158,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":2.5875},{"region":"Europe","population":"405000","descriptionFromReview":"Pretty racist to those that arent white, you feel unwelcome, locals stare at you like your alien, you get served last even when your 1st in line, you get ignored and when you walk into a shop you get followed around because the workers think your going to steal something.

If I could go back in time, I never would have gone as I developed chronic fatigue syndrome for 4.5 years starting during this trip, due to overvaccinating (several tropical diseases injected into me in a short time), the Malarone effects, poor diet, stress, etc. I stopped by Doula for a one night stay both when I arrived and when I left. Do not give men at the airport money. Don't let anyone handle your suitcases. Guys came out wearing (fake) uniforms, then repeatedly demanded money from me. I eventually told them in French to \"leave me alone,\" which worked, but the cab drivers took my luggage even though I told them I was waiting for the hotel to pick me up (hotels should do this, I used Ibis and it was very clean and comfortable, with hot water). The woman working at Ibis told me not to go outside at all, even during the day. (I was traveling alone.) An activist I met in Kumbo said they knew someone who was robbed at knife point at 11 a.m. in Doula. I had black stuff coming out of my nose after the bus ride through town from the pollution being so bad. The airport demanded more money when I returned, and I honestly couldn't tell if it was legit, the guy kept insisting and they even had a booth. Living in Kumbo, I was one of only about 10 white people I saw the entire time I was in Cameroon. It took three days to travel between there and Doula. I felt much more comfortable in the small town, but was often lectured by older men about not greeting properly (once said \"hey\" to my friend and he berated me for being so casual until I started crying). I had stomach spasms from eating and developed a rash from the dirty water (though there are clean water sources, I just chose to use the shower instead of a bucket). I spoke French in Doula and English in the Northwest region, I'm not sure if many people speak English in Doula or not. I met people who'd gotten malaria while staying in Cameroon, and people waited to take malaria pills till after they got sick, since it's the same pill (which is what I'd do in hindsight). Overall, it was the most culture shock I've ever had and a very challenging experience. As far as I know, people only traveled there to help social causes like I was (the Peacecorps has a presence), not for tourism. I'm not sure how it is now, but in 2009, I had to go to a (pretty slow) internet cafe, didn't have internet at home (though I believe they had it in the Doula Ibis hotel), and there were days-long electricity outages. So I don't know that it would make sense for a digital nomad long term.","slug":"douala-cameroon","short_slug":"douala","long_slug":"douala-cameroon","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":1,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/douala-cameroon-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u675c\u963f\u62c9","name":"Douala","country_chinese":"\u5580\u9ea6\u9686","air_quality_now":null,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"4.0359007","longitude":"9.671764","country":"Cameroon","country_code":"CM","country_slug":"cameroon","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":2,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"83","rank":681,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"87.512","temperatureC_feels_like":41,"temperatureF_feels_like":106,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1202,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1055,"cost_for_local_in_usd":756,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2646.7197798735674,"overall_score":3.2144676063317394,"cost_score":5,"internet_score":0.4414473684210527,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":3},{"region":"Latin America","population":"845801","descriptionFromReview":"I was there for one week and stayed in Bocagrande, about a 10 minute taxi ride from the Walled City.  Pros of Cartagena:  Inexpensive locale, reliable and fast internet, good weather (if you like it hot), not terribly crowded (aside from Walled City), beauty\/history\/nightlife of Walled City.  Cons:  Local beaches are average at best and riddled with vendors who accost visitors non-stop, street vendors are less pushy but everywhere, fluency in Spanish is very helpful (not really a con, just is), Walled City is loaded with tourists and priced accordingly.  Cartagena struck me as a one-trick pony like a Las Vegas.  Some people love Vegas because of the weather and the entertainment.  Cartagena has the weather and the Walled City.

study in Leiden, and I love it here! The city is beautiful, and quaint enough that you can bike from end to end in 10-15 minutes. Because it's a student town there's also a lot to do here, even for non-students. By West-European standards the prices are reasonable. Pretty much everyone speaks English fairly well, and Dutch is not too hard to pick up on. The location of Leiden in the Netherlands is also neat: 10 min by train to The Hague, 20-ish to Schiphol Airport, 30 min to Rotterdam, 40-ish min to Amsterdam and Utrecht. The biggest drawback I can think of is the fact that the housing market is very oversaturated because of the number of students who live here, so it might be tough to find a place to stay.

New Hampshire is an incredible state if you want to experience nature. Not a lot to do within the city itself. Excellent internet service. Very cold in the winter.

The cost of living ($4,000+ USD) is based on if you paid per night at one of the fanciest hotels in Minca.  Minca is a small, out in the middle of nowhere place that has a collection of hostels advertising yoga retreats, nature, horse rides, partying, etc. along with some hotels.  Locals who own homes in Minca either live there and make a living off of farming or the tourist industry, or they use the country home as an escape from city life.  Thus, there probably are not many Airbnbs or apartments for rent in Minca, and the Internet connection is probably either not great or not existent (I remember the hostel had a generator which would kick on during power outages).

Train to Bangkok is older and slower, but avoids traffic. There are plenty of mini-buses and taxis plying the route as well. Figure 4 hours door to door.\n\nIt's blissfully free of digital nomads  (even though there is a coworking space and plenty of coffee shops) has great grocery stores, a few clean malls if you need that stuff, and some of the best seafood in Thailand. My advice is to stay south of the main strip of hotels in the quiet, and charming, Khao Takiap area or even farther south in the village of Khao Tao. \n\nSome nice condos\/Airbnbs (monthly rental only), great walking beaches, and cheap seafood restaurants filled mostly with polite, older Euros and Thai families on vacation. Also tons of random expat owned venues like a petanque bar, or a German bakery, or Southern USA BBQ spot. \n\nUnlike Phuket or Pattaya the sex trafficking is not as overt. You mostly see older, beer-fattened Australians\/Brits with their middle-aged Thai wives. \n\nOverall, highly recommended if you like Thailand but want to try something different. And can eat your weight in crab.\n\nScooter is a must have, as there is a taxi mafia that forces the Grab drivers to pick up in weird places (mostly 7\/11 parking lots instead of in front of wherever you are).\n\nReally amazing national park about an hour south with waterfalls, caves, cave temples, and the largest protected wetland in Thailand (tons of birds). 1. 5 hours west is a national forest\/waterfall where you can still see wild elephants on the roads (not the slave labor elephants like you see in Chiang Mai).\n\nI'd recommend coming in the 'rainy' season. By quirk of geography (mountains to the west) it gets much, much less rain than similarly located areas in the wet season.

services are shockingly backward and inefficient. Zero ease of doing business. This review is about Dakar specifically. Very difficult to find high quality consumer products in one centre of commerce, you have to go to random little shops all over the city. Most places don't have websites or have non-functional websites with bugs in online enquiry forms making it difficult to obtain information. E-commerce sites are poorly designed and barely function, and they don't accept credit card payments, you have to have an Orange Money account or cash on delivery. It's all very expensive and honestly not that great. Roads are not maintained, resulting in damage to car shocks and tyres. A lot of land pollution, litter everywhere including on beaches. Municipal services largely non-functional. Not safe for a single woman unless you have a car. Drivers have no issue with colliding with you and it's normal for most cars to be pretty banged up. Yellow cabs very old and in bad shape. These and the buses contribute hugely to air pollution because they're not roadworthy. Quality of petrol and diesel is so bad that it causes really bad air pollution and it's almost impossible to ever take a breath of clean, fresh air. The people of Dakar deserve better.","slug":"dakar-senegal","short_slug":"dakar","long_slug":"dakar-senegal","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":12,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/dakar-senegal-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u8fbe\u5580\u5c14","name":"Dakar","country_chinese":"\u585e\u5185\u52a0\u5c14","air_quality_now":46,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"14.7645042","longitude":"-17.3660286","country":"Senegal","country_code":"SN","country_slug":"senegal","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":4,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.52,"humidity":"64","rank":984,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"27","temperatureF":"80.284","temperatureC_feels_like":29,"temperatureF_feels_like":84,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2759,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":940,"cost_for_local_in_usd":570,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1994.4971496749467,"overall_score":2.9479026331844262,"cost_score":3.561142857142857,"internet_score":1.0065789473684208,"leisure_quality":5,"safety_level":3},{"region":"Europe","population":"484344","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"lyon-france","short_slug":"lyon","long_slug":"lyon-france","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":6,"users_been_count":210,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/lyon-france-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u91cc\u6602","name":"Lyon","country_chinese":"\u6cd5\u56fd","air_quality_now":55,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"45.764043","longitude":"4.835659","country":"France","country_code":"FR","country_slug":"france","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":28,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.314285714285715,"humidity":"82","rank":985,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"6","temperatureF":"42.52","temperatureC_feels_like":6,"temperatureF_feels_like":43,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3277,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":2127,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1367,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4784.815881194121,"overall_score":2.9466279114375333,"cost_score":2.969142857142857,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":4,"safety_level":3.7},{"region":"Asia","population":"1567499","descriptionFromReview":"As an expat in Ningbo the past two years, these scores aren\u2019t really accurate in my opinion.

I love the pier and city library, and this is the most famous area in Oulu where you can find many interesting events like the Polar Bear Pitch, Farmer's Market, MegaMatching, etc. Besides being called the Silicon Valley of Finland, Oulu is also a heaven to outdoor lovers with many trail paths as well as their campfires and saunas along the rivers and lakes. \nTo me Oulu is perfect for Nomads who are up to challenges.","slug":"oulu-finland","short_slug":"oulu","long_slug":"oulu-finland","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":3,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/oulu-finland-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5965\u5362","name":"Oulu","country_chinese":"\u82ac\u5170","air_quality_now":18,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"65.0126148","longitude":"25.4714526","country":"Finland","country_code":"FI","country_slug":"finland","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":27,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"98","rank":990,"weather_icon":"wi-day-rain","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"2","temperatureF":"35.93","temperatureC_feels_like":0,"temperatureF_feels_like":0,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":3915,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1479,"cost_for_local_in_usd":914,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3199.121078951356,"overall_score":2.9405228149417564,"cost_score":2.24,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"2","safety_level":3.075},{"region":"Africa","population":"915101","descriptionFromReview":"I enjoyed the beaches in Diani, Kilifi, and Watamu.

is a lovely and friendly place filled with plenty of shopping areas, plenty of cuisines all over the city whatever your pallet may be and is not too expensive shall you go to the right places, my favourites being YO! sushi which I loved to go with my partner (the furukaki fries now named yo fries are to die for) but while here there are a lot of things you must do; buy welsh cakes and get yourself a coffee or tea they are delicious little flat cakes sold all over the city for cheap usually cheaper in bulk. I saw 10 for 3 pounds in many flavours, raisins, chocolate, cinnamon, lemon the list goes on. next you need to go to Cardiff castle (it can be pricey) during normal session it costs 13 pound a person but during popular events like football it is often free to visit and climb the castle which is what I did during a football game in the millennium stadium and yes it does get crowded when these games are on but the good thing being in the city the roads close so people can walk on the roads making it easier to not get stepped on. while here you need to try a nice pub at least one time while I cant remember the name there is a lovely cocktail bar\/pub that does 2 for 1 cocktails for 7 pound (my favourite being buffalo soldier (which is rum, ginger beer and apple juice with lime added and its delicious). when you are here make sure you check out the welsh gift shops and get a few souvenirs here, the amount of highly detailed and shiny dragon statues you can buy are insane so if you like castles, medieval literature and dragons (and sheep) make sure you come to Cardiff for a break from

People are generally friendly and laid back, lots of tourists, plenty of hipsters. Lots of rich people and celebs own houses here.

The people seem pretty miserable, but they are friendly enough to foreigners and nice to Americans.  Like much of Ukraine, the dollar goes a long way here, so you can be pampered and eat well very cheap.  The 2 biggest problems are (1) there isn't much to do here, and (2) it is an awful 8 hr car ride or train ride from Kyiv, so the city is kind of isolated.  Much pollution also (think of Pittsburgh PA in the 60's) so the quality of life is poor.  Very few hotels, so you'll have to rent a flat on AirBNB for only 20 USD\/Euro per night.

lived in Chongqing for about 5 years. I mostly love this place but it's not easy for Westerners unless you can speak some Chinese. But with a smartphone you can translate anything you need to say. Chongqing is beautiful, gritty and romantic. Extremely inexpensive and lots of things to do. Beautiful women. Maybe the most unique city in China. Weather terrible in winter and summer. Winter is foggy, rainy and low light while summers are uncomfortably hot and humid. They don't speak standard Mandarin here so even Chinese from Beijing can't talk to the locals. I had the time of my life here but it's too strange and foreign for many. Not like going to Thailand or the Philippines.

But I've spent a lot of time in Windsor so I can provide some overview. Windsor is a border town across from Detroit, Michigan, USA. A lot of day-trippers visit from other areas of Ontario and Michigan to visit the Caesar's Casino, which is a very nice casino if you're into gaming. Other than that there's not much to do other than enjoy the views of the Detroit skyline from the riverwalk. I always feel safe in Windsor. Like most of Canada, Windsor is expensive, but internet service and other infrastructure are great for working. Winters are extreme. Some Canadians have anti-American attitudes, unfortunately. If you're American be prepared to ignore these people and focus your time on the friendly locals.","slug":"windsor-canada","short_slug":"windsor","long_slug":"windsor-canada","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":15,"users_been_count":10,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/windsor-canada-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u6e29\u838e","name":"Windsor","country_chinese":"\u52a0\u62ff\u5927","air_quality_now":13,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"42.3149367","longitude":"-83.0363633","country":"Canada","country_code":"CA","country_slug":"canada","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":24,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5,"humidity":"74","rank":1057,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"1","temperatureF":"33.77","temperatureC_feels_like":0,"temperatureF_feels_like":0,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":6058,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1797,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1005,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3516.917499080889,"overall_score":2.8785796265649193,"cost_score":1,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":3.3375},{"region":"Middle East","population":"3976400","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"jeddah-saudi-arabia","short_slug":"jeddah","long_slug":"jeddah-saudi-arabia","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":17,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/jeddah-saudi-arabia-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u5409\u8fbe","name":"Jeddah","country_chinese":"\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f","air_quality_now":64,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"21.543333","longitude":"39.172778","country":"Saudi Arabia","country_code":"SA","country_slug":"saudi-arabia","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":8,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.1085714285714285,"humidity":"46","rank":1058,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"29","temperatureF":"83.442","temperatureC_feels_like":29,"temperatureF_feels_like":84,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2405,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1610,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1049,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3669.7985657613513,"overall_score":2.875869053944043,"cost_score":3.9657142857142857,"internet_score":1.9641447368421057,"leisure_quality":1,"safety_level":3.7125},{"region":"Asia","population":"12528300","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"shenzhen-china","short_slug":"shenzhen","long_slug":"shenzhen-china","users_now_count":1,"users_now_count_est":18,"users_been_count":131,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/shenzhen-china-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u6df1\u5733","name":"Shenzhen","country_chinese":"\u4e2d\u56fd","air_quality_now":132,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"22.543099","longitude":"114.057868","country":"China","country_code":"CN","country_slug":"china","state_code":"","state_chinese":"","state":"","internet_speed":2,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":2.0542857142857143,"humidity":"62","rank":1059,"weather_icon":"wi-day-sunny","weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"22","temperatureF":"71.37","temperatureC_feels_like":22,"temperatureF_feels_like":72,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2002,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1261,"cost_for_local_in_usd":876,"cost_for_family_in_usd":3064.6395982607637,"overall_score":2.875188067713049,"cost_score":4.426285714285714,"internet_score":0.3289473684210526,"leisure_quality":2,"safety_level":3.925},{"region":"North America","population":"112123","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"elgin-il-united-states","short_slug":"elgin","long_slug":"elgin-il-united-states","users_now_count":null,"users_now_count_est":null,"users_been_count":null,"image":"\/assets\/img\/places\/elgin-il-united-states-600px.jpg","name_chinese":"\u57c3\u5c14\u91d1","name":"Elgin","country_chinese":"\u7f8e\u56fd","air_quality_now":44,"air_quality":null,"latitude":42.0372,"longitude":-88.2812,"country":"United States","country_code":"US","country_slug":"united-states","state_code":"IL","state_chinese":null,"state":"IL","internet_speed":62,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.565714285714286,"humidity":"80","rank":1060,"weather_icon":"wi-day-cloudy","weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"2","temperatureF":"35.98","temperatureC_feels_like":2,"temperatureF_feels_like":36,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":4616,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":3162,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1443,"cost_for_family_in_usd":5049.687499999999,"overall_score":2.8694395033847813,"cost_score":1.4388571428571428,"internet_score":5,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":4.164353591488025},{"region":"Europe","population":"2752636","descriptionFromReview":"Rome has tourist fatigue.

like Baoding and think it is an underrated city in China. I have stayed there visiting in-laws for a few weeks at a time. While, unlike Beijing, you will probably never encounter a single English speaker, you can experience a very similar lifestyle as Beijing at a fraction of the cost. Baoding has a great shopping mall (Wanbo Square) that has any kind of food you could want. Realistically, you could stay in a great hotel for somewhat cheap for a couple months at a time. You could also choose to stay in an AirBnb as many of the apartments are relatively new and clean on the inside-- but as with all individual lodgings, as with all private residences in China, as a foreigner you MUST register with the local police within a day of arrival. I've never experienced any trouble with Baoding law enforcement while registering. If you want to experience unique parts of Beijing, traveling over to Beijing is extremely cheap-- less than $10 USD for the high speed rail. \n\ntldr: comparatively inexpensive and good quality life, some grasp of Chinese is a must, follow local laws.

lived in Chania for over ten years now and I can't wait to get out of here. It's nice for a short visit but nothing else. Everyone talks about the hospitality and friendliness of the locals... that's only because you're a tourist and they want your money! They are corrupt, cheats, liars, and arrogant. They care only about themselves and are extremely greedy.\n\nThe police are terribly corrupt and can't be relied on. The hospital is disgusting with stray dogs roaming around inside. They still even smoke in the public hospital! I know this because I spent 2 weeks there and when I complained about it the nurse told me there's nothing they can do. \n\nAnyway, I could go on and on about the other side of Chania, and Crete in general, that no one speaks about. I'm very disappointed and disheartened by my experience here. The paradise everyone talks about doesn't exist for me. I've had so many people share similar experiences but no one talks about them. \n\nIt's all superficial and everything is not what it

I was enchanted.  The juxtaposition of old and new, rich and poor, high-end retail and street fare was something to see.  Apparently one of the cheapest places to rent in India, although I fell back on a hotel (I know, not very nomad)....  Still, it was not bad. Internet was fast enough for research and posting work, but there are filters on access in various places in India, so for example I couldn't get my Tunnel to function here (may have just been my chosen access points filtered it).  There are internet cafes (Starbucks, etc) in the Park Street area that I could use. English is widely (but NOT universally) understood, but you will also run up against Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. The food is fabulous, with every possibility you can imagine (oh yeah, nice brewpubs and pizza for the unadventurous).  Even if you are not a vegetarian, trust me, these folks can cook in ways that you won't miss meat (and this from a guy who likes BBQ). Currency exchange is best done at a bank, don't trust the ATM's that are stuck to the side of a building. Although the NomadList says otherwise, I was able to use my plastic for a lot of purchases- India is pretty progressive depending on where you are.  Use a \"Prepaid taxi\" to get from the airport to town, which you can get from a booth inside the main terminal... Don't use UBER at the airport as the crazy insanity of the pickup area makes getting your ride nearly impossible (otherwise UBER in Kolkata is fine).  I miss Kolkata, I will be back.

love Rishikesh, and it's a very pleasant place to live as a digital nomad. Prices are very cheap and it is lovely to have an ashram to go to every day. The flow of life is easy because I take with myself the backpack with the computer to a cafe by Ganga and have some nice healthy breakfast, at 08:00 am, and work to about 10:30. Then i go to Sachcha Dham Ashram join a Bhajans and listen to Satsang from my Guru there. Then i go out with my friends to a nice place to spend the day. Other days i work after that to about 5 Pm, and walk to Parmarth Niketan Ashram for som Bhajans and Satsang, and maybe a session of Yoga to, before i go to an restturant and have an evening meal before going home. \n\nNow that i am older an have traveled on and off for over twenty years, i have found my home in Rishikesh, and i am suppriced that there is not more Digital Nomads there than it is, but i am pretty shure that that will change in the future
